In this challenge, you will pass instances of the Bike class into a DockingStation instance. You will store those Bike instances as an attribute of the DockingStation instance, using an instance variable. Then, use an attribute reader to allow access to the instance variable from the DockingStation public interface.

Write RSpec tests that require arguments
Pass an instance as an argument
Set an attribute on an instantiated Object using an @ instance variable
Use attr_reader to read an attribute on an instantiated Object
To complete this challenge, you will need to:
 Write a feature test for docking a bike at a docking station
 Write a unit test for the method you need to add to DockingStation to make docking possible
 Pass both tests
 Use an instance variable with attr_reader to do a full test-implementation cycle for the second User Story above
